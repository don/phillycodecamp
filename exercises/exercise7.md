# Exercise 7: Buttons

We need to rewire the hardware for the next exercises with Azure. We are going to move the LED to the right and add three buttons. If you're unfamiliar with buttons the [Arduino button tutorial](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/Button) may be helpful.

## Suggested wiring instructions:

1. Move the LED from E1 and E2 to C13 and C14. Ensure the longer leg is in C14.
   * Move the resistor from C1 so that it goes between A13 to the negative rail
   * Move the blue wire attached to pin 6 to A14 so it connects to the positive leg of the LED
1. Add 3 buttons at E1, E4, and E7
   * The buttons should straddle the center line on the board
   * Add a 10,000 &#937; pulldown resistors to the right leg of each button
     * 10,000 &#937; resistor from A3 to the negative rail
     * 10,000 &#937; resistor from A6 to the negative rail
     * 10,000 &#937; resistor from A9 to the negative rail
   * Add red (or orange) wire from the positive rail to the left leg of each button
     * A1 to the positive rail
     * A4 to the positive rail
     * A7 to the positive rail
   * Wire the right leg on the top half of the button to pins 3, 4, and 5
     * Blue wire from J3 to J17 (pin 5)
     * Purple wire from J6 to J18 (pin 4) 
     * Yello wire from J9 to J19 (pin 3)

## Test

1. Open [/arduino/ButtonTest/ButtonTest.ino](/arduino/ButtonTest/ButtonTest.ino) in the Arduino IDE
1. Upload the code to the board _Tools -> Upload_
1. Open the serial monitor _Tools -> Serial Monitor_
1. Verify you see a message in the serial monitor when a button is pressed
1. Verify the LED lights when a button is pressed
